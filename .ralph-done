# Implementation Complete

All automated tasks in plan.md have been completed:
- Phase 1-13: All code changes implemented
- Phase 14.1: Typecheck passes
- Phase 14.2: All 33 tests pass
- Phase 14.8: Build succeeds

## Remaining: Manual Testing (Phases 14.3-14.7)
These tasks require human interaction with the TUI:
- Basic navigation (j/k/gg/G/Enter)
- App management (t/e/x/r/K)
- Focus toggle (Ctrl+A)
- Other shortcuts (Space/q/Ctrl+C)
- StatusBar indicators

Run `bun run dev` to manually verify the keyboard system works as expected.
