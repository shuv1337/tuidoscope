The design spec is complete. Here's a summary of **tuidiscope**:

## Summary

**tuidiscope** is a TUI management app with:

- **Vertical tab sidebar** (scrollable) for configured TUI apps
- **Embedded terminals** via ghostty-opentui (full VT emulation)
- **Per-app working directories** with path expansion (~, `<CONFIG_DIR>`)
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+P) with fuzzy search for quick switching
- **Session persistence** - remembers running apps across restarts
- **Runtime entry management** - add/remove apps, changes saved to config
- **Custom keybinds and themes** via YAML configuration

**Tech stack**: SolidJS + @opentui/solid, ghostty-opentui, node-pty, Bun runtime

**5 implementation phases** from core foundation through polish and edge cases.
